# Use VoltScript Extension forms

This section gives you a basic introduction and details on how to use the various forms used when creating VoltScript Extensions (VSE). You can use these forms to create the foundation or "skeleton" for your extension and plan out your architecture before you write the code. It can then generate the skeleton files for your C/C++ project. This area can also be used to generate a set of API docs based on the signatures of your extension.

Refer to the following links to learn more about the forms and know how to use them. 

- [Project](project.md) - The form used to define the overall project definition for your extension
- [Class](class.md) - The form used to define the classes in your extension
- [Property](property.md) - The form used to define the properties of the class
- [Method](method.md) - The form used to define the methods, such as subs and functions, of the class
- [Event](event.md) - The form used to define any events of the class
