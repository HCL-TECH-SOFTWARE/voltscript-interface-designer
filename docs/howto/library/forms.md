# Use VoltScript Library forms

This section gives you a basic introduction and details on how to use the various forms used when creating VoltScript Libraries (VSS). You can use these forms to create the foundation/"skeleton" for your library, and plan out your architecture before you write the code.  

This area can also be used to generate a API documentation based on the signatures of your library.

Refer to the following links to learn more about the forms and know how to use them.  

- [Project](project.md) - The form used to define the overall project definition for your library.
- [Type](type.md) - The form used to define a specific *Type* for the Project.
- [Class](class.md) - The form used to define the classes in your library.
- [Property](property.md) - The form used to define any Global-scope properties of the Project, or Local-scope variables of the class.
- [Method](method.md) - The form used to define the methods, such as subs and functions, of the class.
- [Variable](variable.md) - The form used to define any Global-scope variables of the Project, or Local-scope variables for a specific class.
