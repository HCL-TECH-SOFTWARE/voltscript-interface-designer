# Welcome to VoltScript Interface Designer documentation

VoltScript Interface Designer (VSID) is an application for scaffolding VoltScript Extensions and Libraries, generating and updating starter code, and generating API documentation. VSID is an updated version of the LSX Toolkit, which was originally used to build LotusScript Extensions (LSX) for Notes and Domino. The original LSX Toolkit was updated so that it can be used to build *VoltScript Extensions* (VSE), and now it can also be used to document and build the starting code for *VoltScript Script Libraries* (VSS).

- *VoltScript Extension* (VSE) is a compiled module, written in C++, used to extend and add functionality to the VoltScript language. It's similar to the original LSXes provided for LotusScript.
- *VoltScript Script library* (VSS) is a script library, written in VoltScript, that has a set of classes, properties, methods, subs, and functions that can be used to enhance the VoltScript language. It's similar to the LotusScript Script Libraries used in Notes/Domino applications.

## Get started

- [Installation and setup](tutorials/setup.md)
- [Tutorial](tutorials/index.md)
- [VoltScript Extension Samples](tutorials/vsesamples/index.md)

<!--The VSID repository is comprised of the following items:

- *VSID Notes template* (VSID.NTF) - a Notes-based database template (NTF) that is used to create VSID databases
- *VSID Wizard DLL* (LSXWIZRD.DLL) - a DLL used to by VSID to compile and set up the VSE directory structure and files for your VSE on your computer
- This help documentation

You can learn more about installing and setting up VSID in the [Installation and setup](howto/setup.md) documention under [How-to guides](howto/index.md)-->

## How the documentation is organized

The documentation is based on the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer”}, which organizes documentation into the following modes to address users' documentation needs at different times and in different circumstances. Below shows an overview that guides you on where to look for needed information:

**[Tutorials](tutorials/index.md)** - Hands-on introduction on how to use VoltScript Interface Designer

**[How-to guides](howto/index.md)** - Practical step-by-step guides for performing tasks and operation

**[Topic guides](topicguides/index.md)** - High-level discussion and explanation of key topics and concepts in VoltScript Interface Designer

**[References](references/index.md)** - Contain API documentation and test reports
