# Contributing Guidelines

## NOTICE 
Until Source Control Update for V14 have been shipped, no contributions to the ODP will be possible by non-HCL contributors. 

## Contributor roles

Open source should not be just about writing code. A good open source project also needs:

- Documentation writers
- Testers
- Tutorial writers
- Evangelists
- Automation builders

If you want to get involved in a role (including ones we may have missed!) reach out to one of the committers.

## Working on issues

- Ensure there is a GitHub issue for any bug before submitting a PR.
- Enhancements should be discussed and a feature request issue created, before starting work on it.
- Fork and raise a PR for work.
- Add tests for any enhancements.
- Ensure documentation is updated accordingly, including adding unit test reports.
- Ensure API docs are updated (speak to an HCL-ite if required).
- Ensure changelog is updated.

## Development Environment

- Develop code with Visual Studio Code and VoltScript extensions, see https://help.hcltechsw.com/docs/voltscript/early-access/howto/writing/index.html.
- Documentation uses Material for MKDocs framework:
    - Write documentation in the relevant area of the docs directory.
    - Preview documentation using MKDocs, either [locally installed with relevant plugins](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) or using the [MKDocs HCL Container Image](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/hcl-mkdocs-build-image)

## PRs

- When ready, complete a PR and submit.
- Review the requirements for submitting a PR, for example writing test and updating documentation.
